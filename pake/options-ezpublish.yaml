### Config. file for the ezpublishbuilder script (rev 0.3.2 and later)
###
### Note that the script will load as well a 2nd config file (if it exists):
###   options-ezpublish-user.yaml
### This allow you to separate sensistive info such as passwords or local info
### such as non-standard paths to tools: the -user config file is not stored in
### git.

            # that has been tagged with the version number of the last build
            # (eg 2012.1 => 2011.12), and then finding the git revision of the build
            # immediately after that one.
